"""
Tournament brackets, hardcoded into variable Trees.

Trees[2**k] gives a bracket for 2**k players where
seeded players are optimally divided over the scheme.
Similar schemes are used for e.g. tennis and darts.

Trees[2**k] says how to distribute the seeds over
the bracket, from top to bottom. Note that with a
number of players 2**(k-1) < n < 2**k, putting the
lowest (2**k - n) seeds as "BYE" ensures that the
first round byes go to the top (2**k - n) seeds.

Note that the numbers are from 1 .. 2**k rather than
0 .. 2**k - 1, so one needs to subtract 1 to obtain
indices to correctly access an array of 2**k players.

Numbers obtained from:
    https://oeis.org/A281589/b281589.txt
Numbers 2**k up to 2**(k+1) - 1 give a pairing order
for 2**k seeded participants.

Further numbers can be taken from there for e.g.
4096 and 8192 participants, and additional trees can
be generated following https://oeis.org/A281589.
